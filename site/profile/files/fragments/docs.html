    Please ensure that all of your trainees are registered via the registration

  <h5>Do I need to install a PDF reader?</h5>
  <p class="answer">
    Probably not. Most modern browsers have a PDF reader built-in or use a platform standard reader. If that is not the
    case for you, then readers such as <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/pdf-reader.html">Adobe Acrobat
      Reader</a> can be used free of charge.
